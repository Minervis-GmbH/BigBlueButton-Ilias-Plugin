Microsoft Internet Explorer and older Edge versions are not supported.</li><li>The firewall you use must not block the following ports: TCP/IP ports 80/443 (for HTTP/HTTPS) and UDP ports in the range 16384 - 32768 (<a href="https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/2.2/configure-firewall.html" target="_blank">Advanced Notes</a>).</li><li>In order to be able to transfer your screen (desktop sharing), you should use Google Chrome and have a high-performance Internet connection.
